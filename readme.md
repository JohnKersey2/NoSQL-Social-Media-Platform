## Criteria

For this project, I had to create a command line application to access a MongoDB database. I had to create models for handling users, friends, posts, and reactions. I also had to create API routes to handle POST, PUT, and DELETE routes to create and delete data as the user needs.

## Known Issues

Reactions not generating their own ID is not allowing me to get a single reaction or delete a reaction

## Future Development Notes

Create a front end to the application
